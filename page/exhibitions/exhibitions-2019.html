                            Our world is filled with parallel matters whose values are often created by comparison and contradiction. Your fortune
                            might be related to someone else’s misfortune. Wealth and poverty can co-exist within a society, yet the two are distant
                            from each other. We often find comfort and/or despair within our own juxtaposed world. The other side of our world gets
                            dismissed perhaps too often by ourselves, like the flip side of the coin and the darker side of the Moon.
