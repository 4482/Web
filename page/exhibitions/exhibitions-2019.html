                        4482 (sasapari), a figure made from combining the international dialing codes of the UK (44) and South Korea (82), is
                        the name adopted by a collective group of Korean Contemporary Artists. Since the group’s first exhibition in 2007, 8
                        successful exhibitions have taken place, presenting inspiring works by over 250 Korean artists who live and work in the
                        UK.
                        </p><p class="paragraph">
                        Following its successful comeback in 2018 after a four-year gap and showcasing inspiring artworks by 54 artists, 4482
                        (sasapari) proposes to make another mark through its exhibition in March 2019 at OXO Bargehouse in London.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                        4482-2019; The Other Side of the Moon will showcase exciting artworks by around 40 UK-based Korean Contemporary artists
                        as well as 3-5 specially selected artists who currently live and work in Korea and who are represented by our sponsor,
                        the Soohoh Gallery in South Korea. It is also hoped to display the artworks of emerging British young artists to
                        represent the collaborative concept between the UK (44) and South Korea (82).
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                        Our world is filled with parallel matters whose values are often created by comparison and contradiction. Your fortune
                        might be related to someone else’s misfortune. Wealth and poverty can co-exist within a society, yet the two are
                        distant from each other. We often find comfort and/or despair within our own juxtaposed world. The other side of our
                        world gets dismissed perhaps too often by ourselves, like the flip side of the coin and the darker side of the Moon.
                        4482-2019; The Other Side of the Moon invites artists with both Korean and UK connections to investigate such
                        contradictions and juxtapositions, the familiar and/or alien aspects of our world through their thought-provoking
                        artworks.

                        The exhibition hopes to reach the attention and the interest of the public, irrespective of background or culture, and
